# Correction to PR Description

The current PR description contains an inaccuracy regarding the .prettierignore file changes. Here is the corrected information:

## Original (Incorrect) Description:
- "Removal of .prettierignore file"

## Corrected Description:
The patch was created from 3 commits that handled .prettierignore as follows:

1. **Commit 419b1628**: Initial branding changes from cellxgene to proteinxlocation **+ added .prettierignore file**
2. **Commit 1fbd320c**: Removed .prettierignore file (reverting the previous addition)
3. **Commit deb08a02**: Updated to use Ã— symbol in titles

## Net Result in Squashed Patch:
The .prettierignore addition and removal cancel each other out in the squashed patch, so the final patch contains **only the frontend branding changes** with no .prettierignore file modifications.

## Verification:
```bash
# The squashed patch applies cleanly to upstream/main
git apply --check proteinxlocation-branding.patch

# And contains only these file changes:
# - client/index_template.html
# - client/package-lock.json  
# - client/package.json
# - client/src/components/app.js
# - client/src/components/framework/logo.js
# - client/src/components/leftSidebar/infoMenu.js
# - client/src/globals.js
```

The patch file itself is correct and ready for use when syncing with upstream.
